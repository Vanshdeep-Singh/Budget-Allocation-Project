Ad Channels Budget Allocation :

-> Developed a data-driven budget allocation model to optimize spending across Google, Microsoft, and Meta ad platforms.

-> Implemented machine learning techniques to analyze ad performance and identify high-impact channels for maximizing conversions.

-> Used Monte Carlo Simulation to model different budget scenarios and improve decision-making under uncertainty.

-> Designed a credit score attribution model using a decay factor to allocate credit to different campaign touchpoints in the customer journey.

-> Processed and analyzed large datasets, using feature engineering and dimensionality reduction (Autoencoder) to extract key insights.

-> Applied LightGBM with dynamic Optuna tuning to incorporate diminishing returns and optimize future budget allocations.

-> Achieved an estimated ROI of 104.44%, with a total budget allocation of â‚¹200,000 and projected 4,379 conversions.

-> Identified limitations and future improvements, such as integrating real-time data and predictive analytics for adaptive budget optimization.
